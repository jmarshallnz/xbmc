XBMC ADDONS
===========
This directory contains the cmake-based buildsystem for addons. It looks into
the "addons" sub-directory and parses all *.txt files. Each addon must have its
own <addon-id>.txt file which must follow the defined format:
  <addon-id> <git-base-url> <git-revision>
where
  * <addon-id> must be identical to the addon's ID as defined in the addon's
    addon.xml
  * <git-base-url> must be the base URL (i.e. the URL must not contain the name
    of the git repository itself) of the git repository containing the addon.
    The name repository of the addon must be <addon-id>.
  * <git-revision> must be a valid git tag/branch/commit in the addon's git
    repository which will be used for the build.

The buildsystem uses the following variables (which can be passed into it when
executing cmake with the -D<variable-name>=<value> option) to e.g. access
specific paths:
  * CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE specifies the type of the build. This can be either "Debug"
    or "Release" (default is "Release").
  * CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX points to the directory where the built addons and their
    additional files (addon.xml, resources ...) will be installed to (defaults
    to <DEPENDS_PATH>).
  * CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE can be used to pass a toolchain file into the add-on
    builds.
  * DEPENDS_PATH points to the directory containing the "include" and "lib"
    directories of the addons' dependencies.
  * XBMCROOT points to the root directory of the xbmc project (default is the
    absolute representation of ../../.. starting from this directory).
  * PACKAGE_ZIP=1 will mean the add-ons will be 'packaged' into a common folder,
    rather than being placed in <CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/lib/xbmc/addons and
    <CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX>/share/xbmc/addons.
  * ARCH_DEFINES specifies the platform-specific C/C++ preprocessor defines
    (defaults to empty).

The buildsystem makes some assumptions about the environment which must be met
by whoever uses it:
  * Any dependencies of the addons must already be built and their include and
    library files must be present in the path pointed to by <CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH> (in
    "include" and "lib" sub-directories).
  * The xbmc-config.cmake.in must be located at <XBMCROOT>/project/cmake. It can
    use any of the variables used in CMakeLists.txt using the @variable@
    notation. The variables will be replaced with the actual values and the
    resulting file will be installed to <PREFIX>/lib/xbmc/xbmc-config.cmake.

To trigger the cmake-based buildsystem the following command must be executed
with <path> being the path to this directory (absolute or relative, allowing for
in-source and out-of-source builds).

  cmake <path> -G <generator>

cmake supports multiple generators, see
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v2.8.8/cmake.html#section_Generators for a list.

In case of additional options the call might look like this

  cmake <path> -G <generator> \
        -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        -DXBMCROOT="<path-to-xbmc-root>" \
        -DARCH_DEFINES="-DTARGET_LINUX" \
        -DDEPENDS_PATH="<path-to-built-depends>" \
        -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<path-to-install-directory"
